IMPORT FILES FROM DRIVE INTO GOOGLE-COLAB:

STEP-1: Import Libraries

# Code to read csv file into colaboratory:
!pip install -U -q PyDrive
from pydrive.auth import GoogleAuth
from pydrive.drive import GoogleDrive
from google.colab import auth
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials

STEP-2: Autheticate E-Mail ID

auth.authenticate_user()
gauth = GoogleAuth()
gauth.credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
drive = GoogleDrive(gauth)

STEP-3: Get File from Drive using file-ID

#2.1 Get the file
downloaded = drive.CreateFile({'id':'1R9vW5dmox7i8OGOoDql_r9yUrvAJgvhD'}) # replace the id with id of file you want to access
downloaded.GetContentFile('resources.csv') 

STEP-4: Read File

#3.1 Read file as panda dataframe
import pandas as pd
xyz = pd.read_csv('resources.csv') 
print(xyz.head(1))

#Repeat STEPs 3 & 4 to load as many files as you require.
